An IssueBrowser is a tool to see all issues of a repository and all relevant information for an issue of choice. You can open it as 'Issue Integration' in the 'Apps'-Menu. If the selected issue is linked to a class or method you can be directed to the right position in the System Browser by pressing the 'Fix me'-Button.
